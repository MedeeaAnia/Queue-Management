## General ideas about the project
The objective of this project is to design a queue-based system by simulating a series of N clients arriving for service, entering Q queues, waiting, being served and finally leaving the queues. The user interface is made in JavaFX.
## Features
- Errors are shown in an alert window.
- Clients are generated randomly based in the number introduced by the user.
- Some test are done in order to see : average waiting time, average service time, peak hour
